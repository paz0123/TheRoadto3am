            <h2>"Who Walks This Road?"</h2>
            <p>"I started The Road to 3:AM during a season when my thoughts were louder than my voice, i wanted to build something that reminds people they're not alone in their silence"</p>
            <p>especially living in a country like Lithunia were everyone mind their business, people are more intovert , so you have to be friends with your thought, your inner man.</p>
            <p>3:AM is a  GHOST HOUR but i find myself waking up every day by 3:AM , i talk to my GOD , I ask questions about the world, how to figure my self out. and to put my thought to reality for people to hear my thought what i could't speak to any one during the day</p>
